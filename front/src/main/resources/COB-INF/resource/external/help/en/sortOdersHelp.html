<font size='16' color='#7722EE' face='Helvetica'>What are 'Sort Orders'</font>
In Lexus sort orders are used to sort entries of lexica. Their structure consists of two elements: "Start Letter" and "Character" that by default have been predefined with the Latin alphabet.

"Start Letter" is the symbol used to represent all the "characters" presented in the "Characters" column of a given letter. It determines how the entries starting with the characters specified in the "Characters" column will be sorted. See the following example:
e.g. Start Letter is "a". The Character is "Aa" (the letters "A" and "a" are mapped on the letter "a" and sorted accordingly).

Moreover, it is also possible to specify multiple characters that should be considered as one Start Letters. In those cases the square brackets are used:
e.g. Start Letter is "a". The Character is "Aa[:a]" (the letters "A", "a" and "[:a]" are mapped on the letter "a" and sorted accordingly).

To add/remove a new element to the sort order, click on +/-. All the predefined Start Letters/Characters? can removed at once by clicking on the Bin icon.

To modify an element, double-click it and edit. It is also possible to change the position of the elements by dragging and dropping them in a desired place in the sort order.

Since "Start Letters" and "Characters" are mandatory when creating a sort order, if one of these elements has not been filled in, a warning message will appear.
