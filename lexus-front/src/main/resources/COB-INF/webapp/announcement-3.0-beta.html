            <div>Dear LEXUS user,<br /><br /></div>
            <div>A release candidate version of the upcoming LEXUS is now available at <a href="http://lux17.mpi.nl/lex/lexus">http://lux17.mpi.nl/lex/lexus</a>.<br/><br/></div>
            <div>Although the main focus of this version has been a complete rewrite of the server
                backend, which you should experience by improved performance and stability, the user
                interface has been improved at several places:</div>
            <ul>
                <li><em>View specification:</em> Views now have a unified interface, both the Lexical
                    Entry View and the List View use the same interface. What's more, you can now
                    define additional views, to be used for instance when generating a PDF. Other
                    uses for views will no doubt be implemented.</li>
                <li><em>Queries and filters:</em> queries and filters have also been unified, they
                    use the same technology and have the same interface. The usability of the
                    interface for creating queries is much improved.</li>
                <li><em>New Search options:</em> There is a new fast search option in the Lexicon
                    Editor. Simply typing text and pressing enter searches the whole lexicon for the
                    text you typed. There's an option to search case sensitive. Search text is also
                    used when a filter is applied, so you can search within the results of a
                    filter.</li>
                <li><em>PDF export:</em> in the lexicon editor there's an "Export a PDF" option. It
                    uses a view (other than the Lexical Entry View and the List View) to generate
                    presentations of lexical entries. The overall output is not very customizable
                    yet, but we welcome your input.</li>
                <li><em>Toolbox conversion:</em> in the Workspace there's a menu option "Convert
                    Toolbox files to Lexus" that let's you upload a Toolbox .typ and a .txt file and
                    gives you a Lexus XML file back. You can then import this Lexus XML file into
                    Lexus, or do your own processing on it to enhance the lexicon.</li>
                <li><em>General bugfixes:</em> there have been numerous bugfixes to improve the
                    stability and usability of the Lexus interface.</li>
            </ul>
            <div>Please feel free to test this new version and its new functionality! We very much
                welcome any feedback like bug reports and/or feature request. Please contact us by
                sending an email to <a href="mailto:lexus@mpi.nl?subject=Lexus%203.0%20Beta">lexus@mpi.nl</a>.</div>
	<div>During the release candidate phase we will be updating this test version frequently to incorporate fixes for all the bugs that you found. To make it easy 
          for you to stay up to date on this we set up the <a href="http://ems03.mpi.nl/lexus/wordpress/">LEXUS Beta Blog</a>. Please keep an eye on this 
	page as it is the main point where we will be announcing updates of this test version.</div>
            <div>Notice that <strong>this test version of LEXUS should not be used for any actual
                    work</strong> on your lexica, i.e., work that you would like to persist.
                    <strong>The test database might need to be refreshed at any time!</strong> The
                test period for the release candidate version will be limited to 1 or 2 months, so the
                improvements will soon be available to you on the production
                server.<br /><br /></div>

            <div>Regards,</div>

            <div>The LEXUS team<br /><br /></div>

            <div>PS: At this moment ViCoS and the XML import facility available on the production server is
                not yet available in the test version, this will be added during the public test
                phase so the new LEXUS will be functionally equivalent to the current one.</div>
