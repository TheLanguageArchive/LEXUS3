The view editor divides the task of styling your lexical entries into two subtasks: creating the structural elements of the view and styling the structural elements using CSS. Just like your webbrowser does with HTML.

For example: you want a heading for the lexeme and a table listing the Part of speech, a definition and a gloss. That defines the structure of your view. To add color to the heading and the table, you use CSS. CSS is a W3C standard capable of creating very elaborate styles and designs, both for styling your lexical entry for the web and print (PDF).

Lexus lets you add a "class" name to every structural element in your view. You use this class name to attach styling to the structural element.

If you have more than one occurrence of the same type of element, for instance a <b>Gloss</b> inside a <b>Sense number group</b> you should take some care of you want to display them in a certain order.

The view generator will just bunch all values for the <b>Gloss</b> element together if you drag the <b>Gloss</b> element from the <b>Lexicon structure</b> panel to a table column or a decorator element. You don't want that.

What you should do is first drag the <b>Sense number group</b> element for the <b>Gloss</b> element out to the structure, <i>then</i> add a decorator or a table row and column and <i>then</i> add the <b>Gloss</b> element.

The view generator will create a list of all the <b>container</b> elements (<b>Sense number group</b>) and process them one by one, creating a separate decorator element for each <b>Gloss</b>. That's what you want.
