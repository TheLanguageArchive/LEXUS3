Changes for:
LEXUS-3.0-RC2-r${buildNumber}


Other issues and improvements:
1. Upgraded HTML front pages.
2. Fixed problem in RelaxNG validation schema to allow import with attributes: "sort-key" 
and  "start-letter" in the "lexical-entry" elements.
3. Fixed problem importing "lexical-entry" elements containing a "resource" child (by design
resources are now dropped upon import. They should be included in the upcoming versions).
