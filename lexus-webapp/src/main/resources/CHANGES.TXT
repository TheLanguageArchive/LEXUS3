Changes for:
LEXUS-3.0-SNAPSHOT-r${buildNumber}

Fixed tickets:
#1011 (partially)

Other issues and improvements:
1. Upgraded to BaseX 7.3
2. Fixed problem with names for new views in some particular cases.
3. Import process revised (ticket: #1011):
	3.1. RNG schema validation reintroduced for uploaded lexicon and schema files.
	3.2. Report import information to the UI: on success=true -> imported lexicon information + number of inserted entries. 
	On success=false -> error descriptions and locations.
	3.3. Possibility to close the import window and keep on working while a lexicon is being imported (open this lexicon 
	is programmatically not allowed).
	3.4. Added intermediate state lexicon information, to warn the user while a lexicon is being imported.
	3.5. Not caching import pipeline.
4. For the schema elements "Lexicon" and "Lexical-entry" the "Mandatory" and "multiples allowed" options, are now fixed 
upon import on LEXUS to "false" and "true" respectively despite of the original values in the imported schema document.
The values for these options are not changeable anymore once inside Lexus.
