Changes for:
LEXUS-3.0-RC3-r${buildNumber}


Other issues and improvements:
1. Enabled ViCoS. 
1. Fix for #2372. Lexicon sort orders are now imported to the user workspace if present in an imported lexicon.
2. Fix for #2387. Structure tree does not lose index when two newly added elements are going to be deleted right away.
3. Fix for #2391. 
	3.1 Possible to search using a filter containing two 'lexicon' elements referring to the same lexicon (added 
	normalizing XSLT template to move every search rule referring to the same lexicon, inside one single 'lexicon' element 
	when a filter is executed). 
	3.2 Creating a filter containing two 'lexicon' elements is now disallowed (option to remove/add new lexicon to a filter 
	disabled at the UI by graying out the buttons).
4. Fix for #2429. White spaces between 'text' elements and datacategory values removed (specifed "indent='no'" in the 
configuration of the cocoon HTML serializer). 
5. Fix for #2390. Pop ups launched from the lexus menu are not anymore hidden behind the lexical entry HTML view (hiding 
the iFrame before drawing the pop up and showing it again when the pop up is closed).
6. Moved cocoon configuration of serializers to front module.
7. Fixed round trip import/export issues when the lexicon has an assigned sort order.
	7.1 The xquery functions used to update the sort keys of the entries after saving a sort order, were moved out of the 
	sort order element in the 'saveSortOrder.xml' pipeline. So these functions don't get saved inside the database.
	7.2 Added template in the STX XML import, to explicitly handle the '<sortorders>' element in the schema file, so it is 
	not	miss saved inside lexicon document in the database.
