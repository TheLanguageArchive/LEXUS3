LEXUS-3.0-SNAPSHOT-r${buildNumber} install notes:


Software requirements:
----------------------
1. Server oriented OS capable of running the specified versions of
Tomcat and BaseX.

2. Apache Tomcat 5.5.x or Jetty 6.1.9. Other JAVA servlet containers
should be possible but were not tested.

3. BaseX 7.0.2 as XML database engine. Though other database engines are 
possible to be used, fast and reliable operation is not warranted.


Installation:
-------------
1. Download and install BaseX 7.0.2 from:
http://files.basex.org/releases

2. Create a new database user in BaseX (by default LEXUS uses the "admin"
user available by default in BaseX with password "admin"). See BaseX 
documentation at:
http://docs.basex.org/wiki/Main_Page

3. Create a database for LEXUS to use (by default LEXUS expects its database
to be called "lexus").

4. Download and install Apache Tomcat 5.5.x from:
http://tomcat.apache.org
See available documentation.

5. Set up the servlet context file to use the user and database values
defined in steps 2 and 3. A Tomcat sample context file can be found in:
META-INF/context.xml.
Also set up other servlet aspects as the LEXUS web application URL.

6. Deploy lexus-webapp-3.0-SNAPSHOT-r${buildNumber}.war to your Tomcat
installation.

7. Start Tomcat with the options:
-> -Djavax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory=org.apache.xalan.processor.TransformerFactoryImpl 
(Use Xalan as XML XSLT processor. Saxon default transformer breaks LEXUS 
HTML views)
-> -Dorg.apache.cocoon.mode=prod (run cocoon is production mode so it
does not generate 'tee' debug files)
