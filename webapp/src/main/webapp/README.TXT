LEXUS-3.0-SNAPSHOT-r28655

 What is it?
 -----------

Lexus is a web-based tool to create and edit lexical databases. Lexus provides each user with a workspace containing her lexica. Lexica can be shared with other users (both read and write permissions can be given). A lexicon has lexical entries, one per word. A lexical entry describes the different linguistic aspects of a word and contains images and video to illustrate usage of the word for example. In the workspace lexica, sortorders and queries can be created. In the schema editor a schema can be created for a particular lexicon. The schema says which data and components can go where in a lexical entry. A lexicon can be built according to a schema that users can develop themselves.

Lexus uses Adobe Flex for the front-end application. The server side is XML based, using a XML database to store lexica, users, sort orders, queries, etc. It uses (mostly) XSLT to transform data from the UI JSON format to XML and back again to JSON, and in the process retrieves data from and stores data to the database.
